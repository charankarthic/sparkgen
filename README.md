# Sparkgen

Sparkgen is an AI-powered gamified learning platform that enables users to play AI-generated quizzes, track achievements, and interact with an AI assistant for learning support. The platform utilizes an API key from DeepSeek R1 via OpenRouter to dynamically generate quiz content and provide personalized chatbot assistance.

## Overview

Sparkgen is built using a client-server architecture, with a React frontend and an Express-based backend. The frontend is served using Vite, while the backend connects to MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based data management. The entire application is deployed on Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend) to ensure scalability and ease of deployment.

Project Structure:

- **Frontend** (`client` directory):
  - ReactJS-based frontend using Vite for the dev server.
  - Shadcn-UI component library integrated with Tailwind CSS framework.
  - Client-side routing managed using `react-router-dom`.
  - Components and pages organized in `client/src/components` and `client/src/pages`.
  
- **Backend** (`server` directory):
  - Express-based server implementing REST API endpoints.
  - MongoDB database support with Mongoose.
  - User authentication using JWT (bearer access and refresh tokens).
  - API endpoints for quizzes, user management, authentication, etc.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Node.js and npm
- MongoDB Atlas account
- Vercel account for frontend deployment
- Render account for backend deployment

### Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/charankarthic/sparkgen.git
   cd sparkgen
   ```

2. **Setting up the environment variables**:
   Create the necessary `.env` files from examples provided (e.g., `server/.env.example`).

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd client
   npm install

   # Install backend dependencies
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the application locally**:
   ```bash
   # Start both frontend and backend servers
   npm run start
   ```

   - The frontend will be available at: `http://localhost:5173`
   - The backend will be available at: `http://localhost:3000`

5. **Deploy the application**:
   - **Backend**: Deploy the backend on Render by following Render's deployment guides and ensure the `DATABASE_URL` and other secrets are set.
   - **Frontend**: Deploy the frontend on Vercel by connecting the GitHub repository and setting the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to point to the backend hosted on Render.

## üöÄ **Performance Notice**  

> - The backend is hosted on **Render's free tier**, which puts the server to sleep after **15 minutes of inactivity**.  
> - The **first request after inactivity may take 20-30 seconds** to load.  
> - Since we use the **DeepSeek R1 API via OpenRouter.com**, generating **quiz questions and chatbot responses may take up to 20 seconds**.  
> - ‚è≥ *We appreciate your patience while the AI processes your request!*
