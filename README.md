# Sparkgen

Sparkgen is an AI-powered gamified learning platform that enables users to participate in AI-generated quizzes, track achievements, and interact with an AI assistant for learning support. The platform uses an API key from DeepSeek R1 via OpenRouter for generating quiz content and providing chatbot assistance.

## Overview

Sparkgen utilizes a client-server architecture:
- **Frontend**: A ReactJS-based frontend housed in the `client/` directory, employing the Vite dev server. The frontend leverages the Shadcn-UI component library with Tailwind CSS for styling and `react-router-dom` for client-side routing.
- **Backend**: An Express-based server located in the `server/` directory, providing REST API endpoints. The backend interacts with a MongoDB database for data storage and utilizes Mongoose for data modeling.

The frontend runs on port 5173 and the backend on port 3000. Concurrently is used to run both the frontend and backend together with a single command (`npm run start`).

### Project Structure
- **client/**: Contains all frontend-related code.
  - `src/`: Holds all source code for the frontend, including pages, components, context, and API interaction files.
  - `public/`: Contains the index.html file that serves as the entry point.
- **server/**: Contains all backend-related code.
  - `routes/`: Houses API route definitions.
  - `models/`: Defines Mongoose schemas for MongoDB collections.
  - `services/`: Contains service classes for business logic.
- **.env**: Environment variable configurations for both client and server.
- **package.json**: Configuration files for project dependencies and scripts.
