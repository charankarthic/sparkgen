# Sparkgen

Sparkgen is an AI-powered gamified learning platform designed to enhance the learning experience through interactive quizzes and an AI assistant. Users can play AI-generated quizzes, track achievements, and receive learning support from an AI assistant. The platform leverages the DeepSeek R1 API via OpenRouter to generate dynamic quiz content and provide personalized chatbot assistance.

## Overview

Sparkgen is built using a modern technology stack, featuring a ReactJS frontend and a Node.js + Express backend, with a MongoDB Atlas database for storage. The frontend is styled using TailwindCSS and Shadcn-UI components, while the backend manages authentication, quiz generation, and user data. The application includes multiple pages such as Home, Games, Achievements, Profile, and interactive quizzes dynamically generated by the AI.

## üöÄ **Performance Notice**  

> - The backend is hosted on **Render's free tier**, which puts the server to sleep after **15 minutes of inactivity**.  
> - The **first request after inactivity may take 20-30 seconds** to load.  
> - Since we use the **DeepSeek R1 API via OpenRouter.com**, generating **quiz questions and chatbot responses may take up to 20 seconds**.  
> - ‚è≥ *We appreciate your patience while the AI processes your request!*
