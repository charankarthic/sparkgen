# Sparkgen

Sparkgen is an AI-powered gamified learning platform that enables users to play AI-generated quizzes, track achievements, and interact with an AI assistant for learning support. The app uses an API key from DeepSeek R1 via OpenRouter to generate quiz content and provide chatbot assistance.

## Overview

The Sparkgen app is implemented using a client-server architecture with ReactJS for the frontend and Node.js + Express for the backend. 

### Architecture

- **Frontend:** 
  - ReactJS-based frontend located in the `client/` folder, served using Vite.
  - The frontend uses Shadcn-UI component library with Tailwind CSS for styling.
  - Client-side routing is implemented using `react-router-dom`.
  - Runs on port 5173.

- **Backend:**
  - Express-based server implementing REST API endpoints in the `server/` folder.
  - Uses MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based data management.
  - The backend runs on port 3000 and is deployed on Render.

### Project Structure

The project is divided into the following main directories:

- `client/`: Contains the React frontend code.
  - `src/`: Main source code directory for the client.
    - `api/`: API request definitions.
    - `components/`: Reusable React components.
    - `contexts/`: Context providers for managing state like authentication.
    - `hooks/`: Custom hooks for various functionalities.
    - `pages/`: Page components for different routes.
    - `utils/`: Utility functions.
