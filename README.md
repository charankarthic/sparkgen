## üöÄ **Performance Notice**  

> - The backend is hosted on **Render's free tier**, which puts the server to sleep after **15 minutes of inactivity**.  
> - The **first request after inactivity may take 20-30 seconds** to load.  
> - Since we use the **DeepSeek R1 API via OpenRouter.com**, generating **quiz questions and chatbot responses may take up to 20 seconds**.  
> - ‚è≥ *We appreciate your patience while the AI processes your request!*
